# Parking-Management-System-OOP

**About the Project**\
\This Parking Management System project was developed as an OOP-based solution to streamline parking lot management. The system allows users to book parking spots, administrators to manage parking areas, and supports billing. By simulating real-world parking scenarios, this project demonstrates OOP principles in C++, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
